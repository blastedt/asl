# Killer is Dead Autosplitter and Load Remover by blastedt

Load removal is vaguely done.  The following are detected as loads:
* Full screen loads
* Episode intros
* Those animated cutscenes before episode intros, like the one before e6
The following are not:
* Streamed loads, like the freeze between Episode 3 and Alice
* Loads where the only indication is the blood spatter on the right side
* Anything not mentioned


Autosplitting is in natal stages.  The following splits are available:
* After every episode, as the ranking screen music begins.  Note that for episode 12 this is long after the end of timing.
* Auto start (including resetting if timer is running)
*   Note that the timing is off - auto start comes about 1.3 seconds after you press A on Very Hard

The following splits are planned:
* Episode 12 "Release" detection
* Transitions between episode and boss

All splits are optional.





# Fable: TLC Autosplitter and Load Remover by blastedt

Load removal is done.
Autosave removal is done but not verified - please watch your timer and make sure it's not pausing inappropriately.

Autosplits are available, check the settings page.  Please note that there is not an autosplit for Dragon Jack - you will need to end the run yourself.

This is release 1, I fully intend to find the remaining splits: Graveyard Path, Imprisonment, Arena Soul, Soul of a Heroine, The Oldest Soul, Dragon Jack. (edit 6/19/16: lol nevermind too hard)

Note that although the three souls do not have individual splits there is an autosplit after you finish donating the guild master's soul ("The Souls of Heroes").

Loading a save is not detected.  If you fuck up, own that shit fam.  Also means you should refrain from pressing Go until the autosave.

# CHANGELOG:

## Fable
1.0.1 (4/29/16):
* Started timing the portaling animation.  As a side effect, the fade-in after a map load will now be timed.  Etem says this is 100% consistent, so it shouldn't matter.


## Killer is Dead
1.0.2 (6/19/16):
* Autostart, autoreset.
1.0.1 (6/19/16):
* Autosplit for episodes 1 through 11
