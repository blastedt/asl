# Fable: TLC Autosplitter and Load Remover

Load removal is done.
Autosave removal is done but not verified - please watch your timer and make sure it's not pausing inappropriately.

Autosplits are available, check the settings page.  Please note that there is not an autosplit for Dragon Jack - you will need to end the run yourself.

This is release 1, I fully intend to find the remaining splits: Graveyard Path, Imprisonment, Arena Soul, Soul of a Heroine, The Oldest Soul, Dragon Jack.

Note that although the three souls do not have individual splits there is an autosplit after you finish donating the guild master's soul ("The Souls of Heroes").
